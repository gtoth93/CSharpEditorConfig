# C# .editorconfig file 
#
# This file's goal is to unify formatting and code style rules for both Visual Studio and Jetbrains 
# Rider. It contains every rule related to C#, with comments explaining what the rule does, and what
# the behavior of IDEs/formatters regarding the rule is.
#
# The general layout of the file:
#   Core EditorConfig Rules (these can be used for any file type, not just C#)
#   Formatting Rules (these rules only add or remove whitespaces, they do not change the code)
#   Code Style Rules (these rules change code that can be written in multiple ways, like var versus 
#     explicit types)
#   Code Analysis Rules (these rules check for potential bugs and code smells)
#
# The general structure of comments:
#   ID (if there is one)
#   Description
#   Possible severities/values
#   Behavior (for each applicable formatter)
#   Remarks (if any)
#   Tags (for grouping and faster searches)
#
# The following is a glossary of available tags, all of them follow the @tag format:
#   @blank-line: rules related to adding/removing blank lines between code elements
#   @braces: rules related to braces
#   @code-quality: rules related to code quality
#   @core: core editorconfig rules
#   @csharpier: rules supported by CSharpier
#   @indentation: indentation related rules
#   @language: rules related to language
#   @formatting: formatting related rules
#   @newline: rules related to new lines
#   @redundant-code: rules related to removing redundant code
#   @rider: Rider/ReSharper rules
#   @space: rules related to spacing between code elements
#   @syntax-style: ReSharper/Rider syntax style rules
#   @wrapping: rules related to line wrapping
#   @style: Code style rules 
#   @unnecessary-code: rules related to removing unnecessary code
#   @vs: Visual Studio/dotnet-format rules

# Remove the line below if you want to inherit .editorconfig settings from higher directories

#### Core EditorConfig Rules: These rules can be applied to any file type ####
[*]

# Description: File character encoding
# Possible values: latin1, utf-8, utf-16be, utf-16le, utf-8-bom
# Behavior:
#   Visual Studio: auto applies setting on save
#   Rider: shows a warning that encoding is different, quick-fix changes the encoding
# Remarks: There are settings in the respective IDEs that may have to be set as well:
#   Visual Studio: Options > Environment > Documents > Save files with a specific encoding > Choose 
#     the correct encoding
#   Rider: Settings > Editor > File Encodings > Global Encoding/Project Encoding/Default encoding 
#     for properties files, also if charset is utf-8, make sure that the 'Create UTF-8 files' 
#     selection is the same as this setting (BOM/no BOM). 
# Tags: @core, @formatting
charset = utf-8

# Description: Line ending file format
# Possible values: lf, crlf, cr
# Behavior:
#   Visual Studio: This rule is not applied to existing files, only newly created ones
#   Rider: This rule is not applied to existing files only newly created ones
#   ReSharper: Changes line endings on formatting
#   dotnet-format: Changes line endings on formatting
#   CSharpier: Changes line endings on formatting
# Remarks: Comment out this rule for 'auto'
# Tags: @core, @csharpier, @formatting, @newline, @rider, @vs
# end_of_line = crlf

# Description: Denotes whether file should end with a newline
# Possible values: true, false
# Behavior:
#   Visual Studio: Adds final newline on save, not when formatting
#   Rider: Adds final newline when saving or formatting, removes it when formatting with false
#   dotnet-format: Adds final newline when formatting, removes it when false
#   CSharpier: Unsupported, final newline is always added
# Tags: @core, @formatting, @newline, @rider, @vs

indent_style = space

# Description: Number of whitespace symbols used for indents
# Possible values: an integer (usually in the range of 2-8)
# Behavior:
#   Visual Studio: if indent_style = space, then it applies the change on formatting, if indent_style = tab,
#     and tab_width is not specified, then it applies a visual change immediately, if tab_width is 
#     specified then it applies the change on formatting 
#   Rider: if indent_style = space, then it applies the change on formatting, if indent_style = tab, 
#     and tab_width is not specified, then it applies a visual change immediately, if tab_width is 
#     specified then this rule is ignored
#   dotnet-format: applies the change on formatting, regardless of indent_style or tab_width
#   CSharpier: if indent_style = space, then it applies the change on formatting, if indent_style = tab, 
#     then it ignores this rule
# Tags: @core, @csharpier, @formatting, @indentation, @rider, @vs
indent_size = 2

# Description: Width of a single tab character (\t)
# Possible values: an integer (usually in the range of 2-8)
# Behavior:
#   Visual Studio: if indent_style = space, this rule is ignored, if indent_style = tab, then it 
#     applies the change on formatting, if tab_width is not divisible by indent_size, or tab_width 
#     is larger than indent_size, then the formatter mixes tabs and spaces for indentation
#   Rider: if indent_style = space, this rule is ignored, if indent_style = tab, then it applies a 
#     visual change
#   dotnet-format: same behavior as Visual Studio
#   CSharpier: If indent_style = tab, then this rule overrides indent_size

# Possible values: an integer (usually in the range of 80-200), off (to turn off hard wrapping)
# Behavior:

#     after wrapping

#### ReSharper rules: Blank Lines ####

# For Visual Studio, the closest equivalent rule for most of these ReSharper rules is

# consecutive blank lines on code cleanup (needs the 'Apply blank line preferences (experimental)' 
# fixer), which would be setting the ReSharper rules to 1. If there are no blank lines between code 
# elements, then no blank lines are added, it has to be added manually. The behavior section won't 
# include Visual Studio, because it is the same behavior for all of these rules.

# Description: Sets how many blank lines should be before and after a region.
# Possible values: an integer (usually in the range of 0-2)
# Behavior:
#   Rider: Adds or removes blank lines before and after region, if resharper_keep_blank_lines_in_declarations 
#     is higher than resharper_blank_lines_around_region, then it will override this rule when
#     removing blank lines.
#   CSharpier: If there are multiple blank lines before the region, one blank line is kept. If there
#     are multiple blank lines after the region, two blank lines are kept. If there are no blank 
#     lines before the region, one blank line is added. If there are no blank lines after the region,

# Rider uses resharper_space_around_ternary_operator to add spaces around ternary operators. For more fine grained control,
# there are separate rules for adding spaces around the question mark and the colon operators: resharper_space_before_ternary_quest,
# resharper_space_after_ternary_quest, resharper_space_before_ternary_colon, resharper_space_after_ternary_colon
# Rider uses csharp_space_before_comma to add spaces before commas. The equivalent rule is resharper_space_before_comma.
# Rider uses csharp_space_after_comma to add spaces after commas. The equivalent rule is resharper_space_after_comma.
# Rider uses csharp_space_before_semicolon_in_for_statement to add spaces before semicolons in for statements. The
# equivalent rule is resharper_space_before_semicolon_in_for_statement.
# Rider uses csharp_space_after_semicolon_in_for_statement to add spaces before semicolons in for statements. The
# equivalent rule is resharper_space_after_semicolon_in_for_statement.
# Rider uses csharp_space_before_colon_in_inheritance_clause to add spaces before the colon in inheritance clauses. The
# equivalent rule is resharper_space_before_colon_in_inheritance_clause.
# Rider uses csharp_space_after_colon_in_inheritance_clause to add spaces after the colon in inheritance clauses. The
# equivalent rule is resharper_space_after_colon_in_inheritance_clause.
# Rider uses csharp_space_after_cast to add a space after a cast. The equivalent rule is resharper_space_after_cast.
